# Machine Learning Part in FloraVista
The primary function of FloraVista is to identify plants by analyzing images of scanned leaves. This functionality necessitates the use of Machine Learning. To achieve this, we developed artificial neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that can effectively perform this task.
